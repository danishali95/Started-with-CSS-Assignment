    <p class="paragraph block1">First paragraph</p>
    <p class="paragraph block2">Second paragraph</p>
    <p class="paragraph block3">Third paragraph</p>

    <P>Explanation of BEM Naming Convention:
        Block: Represents the high-level component or "block" of the HTML element. In this case, the block is the paragraph (paragraph).
        Element: Represents a part of the block that performs a particular function. In this example, there are no specific elements within the paragraphs, but if there were, they would be named accordingly (e.g., paragraph__element).
        Modifier: Represents a variation or modification of the block. In this example, each paragraph has a unique modifier class (block1, block2, block3) to apply distinct styling.
        By following the BEM naming convention, the classes are organized in a structured and meaningful way, making it easier to understand the purpose and scope of each class.
